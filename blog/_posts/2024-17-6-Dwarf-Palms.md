# Dwarfed Palms

When you think of palms you'd probably imagine tall, strong and lean palm trees against a beautiful orange sunset as you feel the warm tropical breeze.

That's not the case for all Palms.

You see, some palms are **dwarfed** this means a stunted dwarf growth and even clustering, leading to smaller palm sizes.

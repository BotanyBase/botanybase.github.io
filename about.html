<h1>Welcome to BotanyBase</h1>

<p>BotanyBase is a non-profit project designed to encourage people’s appreciation and understanding of botany. The main target of our organization is creating an online community, where people can explore, learn and enjoy the plants’ beauty.</p>

<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>

<p>We believe that nature has the capacity to bring about changes in individuals. We want to help individuals develop stronger attachment with nature by offering them simple tools and easy resources. Our approach could be described as team-oriented, as we always try to work shoulder-to-shoulder with our supporters.</p>

<h3>Our Domains</h3>

<p>We have two domains which are proud:</p>

<p>a) botanybase.proj.sbs shows commitment to shared ownerships;</p>

<p>b) (link unavailable) represents dedication towards charity work and community trust.</p>
